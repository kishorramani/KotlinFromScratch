//Object oriented programming - A programming paradigm that uses the concept of classes and object
// OOP Building block - Class and Object, property and Function
//Four main principles of OOP
//1: Encapsulation - Classes are blueprint of object where we put both variable and function, We make object using class - it's encapsulating the data and function together
//2: Inheritance - We can use the property and function of class and another class, Mainly use for code reusability
//3: Abstraction - It's means hiding - Hide internal things and present only needed things. Example: Don't worry about engine to drive car
//4: Polymorphism - Design the classes in a way that we can reuse the same functionality to achieve different behaviour and different classes
